description: "Run the PinchTab optimization loop (Docker, 3 blind subagents on the runner's HIGH model, 108 steps across 47 groups) against chrome, cloak, ghost-chrome, or all three providers. Pass `setup` (optionally followed by a provider or `all`) to run only the setup test (native binary, single subagent forced to the runner's LOW model) that validates the fresh-install OOTB flow per provider. Use when asked to 'run optimization', 'run the opt loop', 'benchmark the agent', '/pinchtab-opt', '/pinchtab-opt cloak', '/pinchtab-opt ghost-chrome', '/pinchtab-opt setup', '/pinchtab-opt setup all', or 'test pinchtab agent'."

# PinchTab Optimization Loop

Two independent modes selected by the argument. They use different runtimes, different models, and answer different questions — only one runs per invocation.

Think of the arg surface as a matrix: **mode × provider**. Model role is fixed by mode (not user-selectable).

| Mode | Providers | Runtime | Model role | Asks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Optimization** (default) | `chrome` (default), `cloak`, `ghost-chrome`, `all` | Docker, 3 parallel subagents | `HIGH` (default/strong) | how few browser ops does the agent need across 108 steps vs baseline |
| **Setup** (`setup` keyword) | `chrome` (default), `cloak`, `ghost-chrome`, `all` | native binary, 1 subagent | `LOW` (small/fast) | can an agent go zero→working from the skill docs alone (OOTB doc-quality gate) |

## Model roles

This skill names model tiers abstractly so any runner (Claude, OpenAI, …) can map them at launch time:

- **`LOW`** — small/fast/cheap model. Used by the setup test because a weak model passing is the actual doc-quality signal; a strong model passing is unsurprising.
- **`HIGH`** — the runner's default/strong model. Used by the optimization benchmark because we want the realistic agent performance, not a deliberately handicapped run.

Suggested mappings (pick whatever the runner has available at the time it executes):

| Runner | `LOW` | `HIGH` |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Haiku (e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5`) | inherit parent (Opus / Sonnet) |
| OpenAI Agents | `gpt-*-mini` tier | `gpt-*` flagship tier |
| Other | smallest capable model | default/best model |

The thresholds below were calibrated for Claude Haiku 4.5 as `LOW`; if you use a different `LOW`, recalibrate the token / tool-call numbers on the first run.

## Argument Parsing

`/pinchtab-opt [setup] [chrome|cloak|ghost-chrome|all]`

Positional args, in order. The first token is either a provider (optimization mode) or the literal `setup` keyword (setup mode); if `setup`, the second token is the provider.

**Optimization mode** (default — no `setup` keyword):
- `/pinchtab-opt` → opt on chrome
- `/pinchtab-opt chrome` → opt on chrome
- `/pinchtab-opt cloak` → opt on CloakBrowser
- `/pinchtab-opt ghost-chrome` → opt on ghost-chrome (Chrome image, ghost-chrome config)
- `/pinchtab-opt all` → opt on chrome, then cloak, then ghost-chrome

**Setup mode** (when first token is `setup`):
- `/pinchtab-opt setup` → setup on chrome (default)
- `/pinchtab-opt setup chrome` → setup on chrome
- `/pinchtab-opt setup cloak` → setup on cloak
- `/pinchtab-opt setup ghost-chrome` → setup on ghost-chrome
- `/pinchtab-opt setup all` → setup on each of the three, in order

Legacy `both` is **removed** (no alias) — use `all` for multi-provider runs. Anything else → print this section and abort.

## Path Resolution

All paths are relative to the **project root** (git root):

```bash
PROJECT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
TOOLS_DIR="$PROJECT_ROOT/tests/tools"
OPT_DIR="$PROJECT_ROOT/tests/optimization"
SETUP_DIR="$PROJECT_ROOT/tests/optimization-setup"
```

The optimization subagents must run with `$TOOLS_DIR` as their working directory because `./scripts/pt` and `./scripts/runner` live there. The setup subagent runs with `$PROJECT_ROOT` as its working directory and builds a native binary.

`up.sh` / `down.sh` live in `$OPT_DIR`.
